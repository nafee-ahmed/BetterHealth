# BetterHealth

* This application has 2 users: doctors and patients. This application hosts an authentication system for both the users. This application facilitates patients to book doctors, send emergency requests and rate doctors. Doctors are able to set the times that they are treating the patients and patients can use those times to send booking requests to a doctor. Patients can also use the Google Map to send emergency requests for example to send an ambulance. After treatment of a booked doctor, patients can rate the doctors. The app has been written on Flutter & Firebase.

* Please download the packages necessary before you run the Flutter application on an emulator. Alternatively, you can run it on a real device. Preferring to run it on a Goole Pixel 4.
